Description: 
Write a method called findModSum1.  The method takes a list of integers.  
The method returns the sum of all the elements that are multiples of 3.
Name: findModSum1
Parameters: int[] data
Returns: int
Preconditions: data is a list of integers. 
findModSum1({21,4,6,9,10,12}) → 21 + 6 + 9 + 12 = 48
